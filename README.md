# Before-the-End

Game design project created as a creative work undergraduate Honors Thesis, BS Digital Arts and Science, Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, University of Florida 

> As an Honors Thesis, this project is intended to exemplify what I have learned from previous classes and projects. Accordingly, it demonstrates a level of efficiency, thoroughness, and polish unseen in certain previous projects (for the prototype stage it is currently in). Also, as the first puzzle game I have worked on, I have learned new creative solutions to new types of problems such as grid-based movement & object interactions and an undo system, which do not rely on Unity's physics and collision systems.
